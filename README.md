### 👋 Hi there, 
I’m @mlepice (Matthieu), a Senior Consultant at Data SEA Consulting, where I help deliver cutting-edge data solutions. 
### 🚀 **Specialization**: 
I specialize in DataOps and MLOps frameworks, ensuring seamless deployment of software releases, data assets and machine learning models. Beyond technical implementation, I take on leadership roles in complex projects, sharing my expertise with internal teams and clients.
### 💼 **Work Experience**:
Before joining Data SEA Consulting, I worked in data science, software development, and prescriptive analytics at global companies like SAS, Danone, and Mars. 
### 🎓 **Education**:
I hold an MSc in Management & Business Analytics from Ivey Business School and an MEng in Operations Research from the University of Technology of Troyes, where I focused on optimization algorithms.
### ⚡ Fun fact:
Outside of work, I’m passionate about physical health, self-improvement, and behavioral psychology—I’m always diving into books and podcasts on these topics. I’m also on a serious mission to discover the best cheese shops and wineries in downtown Toronto (gotta stay connected to my French roots!🧀🍷).
